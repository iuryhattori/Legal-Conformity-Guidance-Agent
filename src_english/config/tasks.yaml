generalExtraction:
  description: >
    Perform a comprehensive, detailed, and scalable extraction of all relevant data from the legal document provided in {info}.
    Your goal is to identify, categorize, and record exclusively procedural and contextual information of a legal nature, regardless of variation in order, format, language, or location in the text.
    Use advanced and flexible parsing methods, including:
      - Recognition by context, synonyms, equivalent terms, abbreviations, and alternative structures.
      - Intelligent search in different sections of the document (header, body, footer, attachments, tables, footnotes, etc.).
      - Pattern detection even in varied numeric, textual, or stylistic formats.
    Always exhaust all attempts to identify legal data, considering:
      - Multiple occurrences of the same information (record all, indicating context or location).
      - Fragmented data or data distributed in different parts of the document.
      - Possible inconsistencies, divergences, or legal contradictions (record and signal all).
    **Attention!** Never record, signal, or mention doubts, gaps, or pending issues arising from technical failures, such as:
      - Errors in reading, parsing, or processing the file
      - Access, format, or integrity problems of the document
      - Operational difficulties, crashes, or any other non-legal issue
    Where there is a real absence of specific legal information, use the <DOUBT> tag, but only after exhausting searches for term variations, positions, and forms of legal presentation.
    Never use <DOUBT> to indicate any scenario of technical failure, reading error, access problem, or document processing issue.
    Never mark <DOUBT> merely for the absence of the "exact keyword" or by expectation of fixed location; always investigate legal alternatives.
    Structure the report in standardized and expandable topics, including (but not limited to):
      - Case identification
      - Parties involved
      - Legal representatives
      - Legal grounds and claims
      - Decisions and orders
      - Procedural movements
      - Relevant dates and deadlines
      - Attached/referenced documents
      - Legal ambiguities, doubts, or points of attention
      - Final comments or contextual legal observations
    Remain open to including new topics as emerging standards or specific case needs require, as long as they are of a legal nature.
    Organize the information clearly, objectively, and in detail, with explicit signaling of doubts, gaps, multiple occurrences, or legal inconsistencies.
    **Never include, record, or cite doubts, pending issues, or observations of a technical nature in the report.**

  expected_output: >
    Structured, standardized, and expandable textual report containing exclusively legal information extracted from {info}, organized by relevant topics for legal analysis.
    For each topic:
      - Present all identified legal occurrences, indicating context/location when applicable.
      - Clearly signal doubts, gaps, ambiguities, or legal inconsistencies, using <DOUBT> only after careful and contextual legal search.
      - **Never use <DOUBT> to indicate errors, failures, doubts, or technical difficulties, nor reading or processing issues.**
      - Add new topics whenever emerging legal standards or document specifics so require.
    The report must be clear, detailed, scalable, and suitable for specialized legal analysis, future automations, and integration with other agents or legal systems.

      - The parties involved (who is suing whom and their respective roles)
      - The reasons and grounds for the case (main claim and cause of action)
      - The legal articles and normative provisions supporting or challenging the case, explaining their application to the concrete situation
    Review all extracted fields, regardless of order, format, or language used, exhausting attempts at identification by context, synonyms, or alternative presentation before declaring absence of data.
    Signal and substantiate any doubts, gaps, or inconsistencies found, detailing which data are missing and what identification attempts were made.
    Always support your explanations by citing examples or excerpts from the structured report.
    Suggest points that can be further analyzed by other specialist agents, if necessary.

      - Reasons and grounds for the case, citing applicable legal provisions and their explanation
      - List of legal articles or normative provisions mentioned, with a brief explanation of the relevance of each
      - Doubts, gaps, or insufficient information, with details of identification attempts made
      - Suggestions for further analysis by specialist agents, if needed
    Avoid generic responses on absence of data; only declare absence if the field is effectively empty or marked as <DOUBT> after exhausting all identification attempts.
    The opinion must be clear, didactic, technically reasoned, and accessible even to those without legal training.

      - Identify, classify, and relate legal, judicial, and conventional deadlines, as well as their respective start and end points.
      - Point out situations of compliance, non-compliance, risks of preclusion, untimeliness, and other critical situations.

    Perform a structured and exhaustive synthesis of procedural information, consolidating multiple specialized technical reports (deadlines, nullities, irregularities, ambiguities, context).
    Your task is to:
      - Consolidate all findings, organizing by relevant thematic category.
      - Eliminate duplicities and redundancies, grouping similar information and retaining all relevant variations (do not discard minority findings).
      - Highlight convergences and divergences between reports, citing examples and indicating the original context of each piece of information.
      - Emphasize doubts, inconsistencies, or informational gaps, clearly indicating the need for clarification or complementation, **but exclude doubts, inconsistencies, or gaps of a technical nature, such as reading errors, file access problems, processing failures, or other non-legal difficulties.**
      - Use checklist and cross-reference techniques to ensure no relevant topic, minority data, or divergent information is omitted.
      - Structure the synthesis by topics/categories, with subtopics when necessary, to facilitate consultation and avoid excessively long lists.

    Analyze the complete Markdown report to optimize visual layout and readability in PDF generation.
    Your task is to:
    - Examine all sections, tables, lists, titles, and long blocks in the received Markdown.
    - Identify critical points where page breaks should be inserted to avoid splitting tables, titles, or lists between pages in the PDF output.
    - Insert page break tags (e.g., <div class="page-break"></div> or <!-- pagebreak -->) before large tables, important section headers, or whenever necessary to maintain logical structure and visual clarity.
    - Adjust spacing as needed to avoid isolated or poorly positioned elements.
    - Do not alter substantive content—only adjust line and page breaks for best PDF format.
    - Ensure each main section (e.g., “Points of Attention”, “Practical Roadmap”, “Doubts or Actions”) starts on a new page whenever possible.
    - Keep the Markdown structure clean and professional, ready for PDF conversion.
    - If in doubt, prefer to add a page break rather than omit it.
    - Before returning, validate that no main table, title, or list is visually split inappropriately.
  expected_output: >
